		<h1>What is this tool?</h1>
		<p>This tool will will help you optimize your Pokemon Go gameplay, specifically when doing gym raids.</p>
		<p>How much damage a Pokemon does in Pokemon Go is calculated in a bit of an odd manner. The damage given is rounded to integers, even though almost all other math is done with decimal numbers.<br>
			As a result you will get a huge boost in DPS (damage per second) when powering up your pokemon to a certain level, while the levels before that will give almost no gain.<br>
			It is important to understand that there is NO connection between CP and DPS whatsoever.</p>
		<p>If you wan't to know what's new check out the <a href="changeLog.html">change log</a>.</p>
		<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
		<p>Primarily to conserve resources. As an example, when fighting a Raid Articuno with a Bite/Stone Edge Tyranitar a level 39 Tyranitar will only do 9.5% more DPS than if it was level 24. That is 196 candies and 181 000 stardust for a less than 10% gain.</p>
		<p>But also to maximize DPS, damage per second. When doing raids your main enemy is the timer. The more DPS you do the bigger is your chance of beating the timer.</p>
		<h2>Why haven't I heard of this before?</h2>
		<p>Because it's complicated. And there's a lot of variables involved. The steps you want to level up to differs not only by species, but also by move set and attack IV (of the attacker), what Pokemon you are fighting and their defense IV. Up until the raids started there we're too many variables involved to be able to make any general statements.</p>
		<h2>What isn't accounted for?</h2>
		<p>A lot of things -- your DPS is also dependent on how much damage your Pokemon will take. And that depends on your pokemons defense IV, the defenders attack IV and their move set. I've however decided to ignore all these things, due to two reasons.<br>
		1) It will introduce too many variables, making it impossible to make any general statements.<br>
		2) It will affect the outcome very little. Your DPS will differ a little bit from the given values but the level you should power up to will stay the same.</p>
		<p>This tool also doesn't account for combinations of legacy moves and new moves that is only available using TM's. Neither does it handle other special cases like Ditto or the move Hidden Power.</p>
		<h2>Who made this tool?</h2>
		<p>I usually go by the name Johanmlg. You can contact me either through reddit (johanmlg) or discord (johanmlg#9906). In Pokemon Go I go by the name johanmlg4711. If you happen to pass by Stockholm you may see me in one of the gyms there. :)</p>
